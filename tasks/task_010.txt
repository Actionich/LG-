# Task ID: 10
# Title: Task #10: Develop Task Management System for AI Benefit Care+ Project Lifecycle
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive task management system to track and organize all UI/UX components, data structures, interactions, and development phases of the AI Benefit Care+ integrated interface project.
# Details:
The task management system should:

1. Break down the AI Benefit Care+ project into granular subtasks organized by screen/feature:
   - Main Dashboard components and interactions
   - Profile Settings page functionality
   - Card/Membership registration flows
   - Benefit Category search implementation
   - AI Chatbot integration and conversation flows

2. For each subtask, track:
   - UI/UX elements from Figma designs (ensuring 1:1 matching)
   - Data structures and API requirements
   - TailwindCSS implementation details
   - SVG asset integration
   - Apple-style component specifications
   - Responsive design requirements
   - Interactive elements and state management

3. Implement a task lifecycle management approach that covers:
   - Design review and approval process
   - Development status tracking
   - Testing procedures and acceptance criteria
   - Deployment preparation and execution
   - Post-deployment monitoring

4. Create a visual dashboard that provides:
   - Overall project progress visualization
   - Critical path identification
   - Resource allocation tracking
   - Deadline management
   - Dependency mapping between tasks

5. Establish integration with existing development tools:
   - Version control system hooks
   - Figma design change notifications
   - Automated testing result integration
   - Deployment status updates

The system should support both Korean and English interfaces to accommodate all team members and maintain consistent terminology across design and development documentation.

# Test Strategy:
Testing the task management system will involve:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify all screens and features of the AI Benefit Care+ project are properly represented as tasks
   - Confirm subtask creation, editing, and status updates work correctly
   - Test task assignment and reassignment functionality
   - Validate notification system for task updates and deadlines
   - Ensure proper tracking of dependencies between tasks

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test integration with version control systems
   - Verify Figma design change notifications are received and processed
   - Confirm automated test results are properly linked to relevant tasks
   - Validate deployment status updates are reflected accurately

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have project managers verify the system meets their workflow needs
   - Confirm designers can easily track implementation status of their designs
   - Ensure developers can efficiently update task status and access requirements
   - Validate QA team can link test results to specific tasks

4. Performance Testing:
   - Test system performance with the full project task load
   - Verify dashboard visualization performance with complete dataset
   - Measure response times for common operations

5. Usability Testing:
   - Evaluate the intuitiveness of the task creation and management interface
   - Test the effectiveness of progress visualization tools
   - Assess the clarity of deadline and dependency representations

6. Acceptance Criteria:
   - All AI Benefit Care+ project components are represented as trackable tasks
   - Full project lifecycle from design to deployment is managed within the system
   - Team members can efficiently update and track task status
   - Project managers can generate accurate progress reports
   - System successfully integrates with existing development tools

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Database Schema and API Specifications [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive database schema and API specifications for the task management system that will support all required data tracking for UI/UX components, project phases, and multilingual support.
### Details:
Design database tables for tasks, subtasks, UI components, project phases, and user assignments. Define relationships between entities. Create API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks, filtering, sorting, and dashboard metrics. Include specifications for both Korean and English field support in all relevant tables. Document data validation rules and required fields for each entity type.

## 2. Implement Core Task Management Backend [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop the backend services for task creation, organization, and lifecycle management that will power the entire system.
### Details:
Implement database models based on approved schema. Create REST API endpoints for task CRUD operations with proper validation. Develop services for task categorization by screen/feature. Implement subtask management with parent-child relationships. Build task lifecycle state machine with appropriate transitions. Create services for tracking UI/UX elements, data structures, and other required attributes. Implement bilingual support for all text fields.

## 3. Develop Project Dashboard and Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create the frontend visualization components that will display project progress, critical paths, resource allocation, and dependencies between tasks.
### Details:
Implement responsive dashboard layout using TailwindCSS. Create progress visualization charts for overall project and individual features. Build critical path identification algorithm and visualization. Develop resource allocation tracking components with filtering capabilities. Implement interactive dependency mapping graph with zoom and filter controls. Create deadline management calendar view with overdue highlighting. Ensure all components support both Korean and English interfaces with proper typography.

## 4. Build Task Detail and Lifecycle Management UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Develop the detailed task management interface that allows tracking of all required attributes and lifecycle states for each task and subtask.
### Details:
